HSPextraction.py
##### programm that extracts bank seq ids from
##### a blast result default flat file.
##### Typical use : ./HSPextraction.blast file.blast ncbi
##### use 454 instead of ncbi if the blastdb has been formated from
##### a 454 generated fasta file.

SubsetQual.py
### program that subsets a qual file giving a subseted
### fasta file. This works if the sequence ordering is
### preserved between the original fasta, and the 
### (typically with cd-hit-454) subseted one
### example of use: SubsetQual.py F64.454.fasta F64.qual 

MaskFasta.py
### needs BioPython libraries
### from a file.fasta and a corresponding file.qual
### masks (i.e. replace by "N") the nucleotides below
### a quality cutoff (arg 2), removes the leading and
### trailing poly "N" and then delete sequences
### that contain more than (arg 3) percent of "N" 

cleanFastaHeaders.py
### from a fasta file
### cleans up the sequences headers removing spaces and adding a "|"

countFasta.py
### Counts several elements in a fasta file:
### the nb of sequences, of residues, and the
### mean sequence length

fastaLenDistrib.py
### Draws an histogramm of sequence lengths
### from a fasta file (arg1) , and giving
### a number of histo bins (arg2)
### a name for the graph (arg3)

fastq2fasta.py
### reads a fastq file and write a fasta file
### if mean sequence quality is below the (arg 2)
### treshold.
### example 1 : fastq2fasta.py seq.fastq 20
### example 2 : fastq2fasta.py seq.fastq 0 (to keep all reads)

GM2fasta.py
### GeneMark default output to fasta

SFF2fastq.py
### Generates a fastq file from a 454 SFF file

SubsetFasta.py
### extracts sequences from a fasta file (arg 1)
### whose id is in the IDs file (arg 2)

countNt.py
# counts all monoNucleotide in a DNA fasta file

countDiNt.py
# counts all dicleotides in a DNA fasta file

GCfasta.py
### from a fasta file (arg1) , and giving
### a number of histo bins (arg2)

countMotif.py
# counts a motif (arg1) with overlaps in a fasta file (arg2)
# example : countMotif.py ACCTTG chitin.fasta

#!/usr/bin/python
### cut a fasta query (arg1) in "nbPart" (arg3)
### subFasta files and launches a blast programm (arg4)
### vs the bank (arg2) for each subfasta and then
### concatenates the tab delimited blast results in
### one file. You can add any additional blastall option in the
### arg5 with quotes like this : "-e 0.001 -a 2 -W 5"
### example of execution :
### paraBlast.py query.fasta blastdb 10 tblastx "-e 0.001 -a 2 -W 5"
